AsciiFree
=========

A python remake of SkiFree in ascii, because why not?




Directory overview:
bin/     -- useful scripts    
engine/  -- first effort will be to create this.  It will hopefully make the creation of the game pretty easy.    
game/    -- holds the code for the SkiFree game.    
archi/   -- notes for architecture.  No code here, just .txts    

## CI as we build out our unit tests, because why not?
